		<p>This experiment aims at studying the effect of loudness on the minimum perceivable difference in frequencies of two tones played one after another. The experiment starts with a loudness calibration for consistency in results across various devices and subjects. At the beginning, the subjects are made to listen to a 1kHz sine wave and asked to reduce the volume slider to such a level beyond which they can hear nothing. We consider this level L0 as 0 dB throughout the scope of this experiment. We have chosen 5 tones, each representing one of the five frequency zones in human audible range - low, mid-low, mid, mid-high and high. These buttons corresponding to the tones are enlisted in the Fixed Frequencies column. Fixed Frequencies in the sense that they will play the same tone whenever the button is clicked, as opposed to the Variable Frequency. The buttons in the column Variable Frequency take input from the sliders corresponding to each of them, and then play the tone. More the slider level, more the frequency of the tone being played on clicking corresponding button in Variable Frequency column. The granularity of the sliders are not same and have been programmed as per the hearing sensitivity in various frequency zones for the convenience of the subjects. To avoid the effects of biasing on subjects, we are not revealing the loudness levels and the frequency values for the tones throughout the experiment. The need for more control in terms of loudness and frequency parameters prompted us to design the entire experiment in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
